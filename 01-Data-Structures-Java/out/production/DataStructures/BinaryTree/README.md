# Tree & Binary Tree

## Some Important Terminologies
### Tree:
- **Degree of Tree** : maximum number of nodes in a tree
- **Terminal/ Leaf Node** : node having 0 degree (generally the last node)
- **Depth of Tree** : Start from root node & go to leaf node.
- **Height of Tree:** : longest path from that node to a leaf node.

### Tyes of Tree:
- **Binary Tree:** Maximum degree of 2 (Degree : 0, 1, 2)
- **Complete Binary Tree:** a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
- **Full BT/ 2 - Tree/ Proper BT/ Strictly BT:**  is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
